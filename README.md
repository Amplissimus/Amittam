# Amittam
Amittam is an open source password manager, that stores mostly all data encrypted using the master password, even the master password itself. It allows realtime updates between devices as soon as the user has verified himself using his Google Account. The user is only granted access to his manually input data by inputting the correct master password on the login screen.
